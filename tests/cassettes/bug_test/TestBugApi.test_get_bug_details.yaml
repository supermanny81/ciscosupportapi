        Network Address Translation Denial of Service Vulnerability","description":"\n\n<B>Symptom:</B>\nA
        vulnerability in the implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality
        in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
        a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\n\nThe vulnerability
        is due to the improper translation of H.323 messages that use the Registration,
        Admission, and Status (RAS) protocol and are sent to an affected device via
        IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
        H.323 RAS packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
        the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in
        a DoS condition.\n\nCisco has released software updates that address this
        vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\n\nThis
        advisory is available at the following link:\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170927-nat\n\nThis
        advisory is part of the September 27, 2017, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS
        XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco
        Security Advisories that describe 13 vulnerabilities. For a complete list
        of the advisories and links to them, see the \" Cisco Event Response: September
        2017 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\"
        which is available at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-63410\n\n<B>Conditions:</B>\nThis
        vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release
        of a Cisco IOS. See the published advisory for more information.\n\nPlease
        see the Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software Checker tool for information on
        non-vulnerable, vulnerable and fixed releases. This tool is available at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\n\n<B>Workaround:</B>\nSee
        published advisory\n\n<B>Further Problem Description:</B>\n<b>PSIRT Evaluation:</b>\nThe
        Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 3 score. The
        Base CVSS score as of the time of evaluation is 8.6:\n\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X\n\nCVE
