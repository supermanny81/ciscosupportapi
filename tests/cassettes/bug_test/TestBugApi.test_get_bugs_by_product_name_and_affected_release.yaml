        shows swap is almost full.\n\n<B>Conditions:</B>\nNone. Unity Connection system
        gradually go into this situation.\n\n<B>Workaround:</B>\nDuring our performance
        runs we did not see any OOM (out of memory) from kernel so system is running
        with high swap usage but there are no performance impacts as we could see
        %VM is in control and there is lot of memory is available in buffers/cache.\n\nTo
        monitor system health related to memory you can do following to identify if
        there are real issues in the system.\n\n1.\tIn RTMT, you can monitor ?Virtual
        Memory Usage? from \"System->Server-> CPU and Memory\". If virtual memory
        usage is growing continuously and not coming down then there will be issues
        in the system. \n2.\tIn RTMT, go to Performance->Memory you can set Custom
        Alerts for below.\n        a.\t%Mem Used (Set a custom alert if %Mem is used
        over 90%)\n        b.\t%VM used (Set Custom alert if it is more than 90%)\n\n3.\tAlso
        you can monitor the memory usage by below command. \n\n        a. show tech

        received from Remote as Unity does not Stream RTP while recording in progress\",\"description\":\"\\n\\n<B>Symptom:</B>\\nRemote
        Devices Sending BYE for Longer Duration Recording as Unity does not Stream
        RTP to End Points when Recording in Process.\\nUnderstanding is that Call
        is getting cut off after 5 min Recording , It is because the remote SBC is
        sending a Bye message since no RTP stream is being received from unity connection.
        \   \\nTherefore the SBC cuts off the call because of a \xAB garbage collector
        \xBB mechanism. This issue has been only Observed for a  Few Customers due
        to their Service Provider disconnecting with these configuration.\\nThe fix
        proposed to Customer is to relax/eliminate the RTP timer on the upstream device
        so that those does not disconnect call.\\nUnity by design doesn't stream any
        RTP while it's allowing callers to record a message , This problem can be
        overcome if Unity Starts to Support RTCP which is currently not supported
        and is Unity Connection backlog.\\n\\n<B>Conditions:</B>\\nConditions are
        :\\n*         Signalization is established with a=sendreceive and 200 OK from
        far end device and Unity connection\\n*         While recording of a voice
        message for longer duration than 5 minutes , we see the RTP stream from the
        end device but NO RTP stream from Unity connection.\\n\\nNOTE : This issue
        is not reproducible in BU LAB and has been seen only on Customers having SIP
        Integrations with Unity Connection.\\n\\n<B>Workaround:</B>\\nWorkaround 1
        : Solutions proposed to Customer is to relax/eliminate the RTP timer on the
        upstream device so that those does not disconnect call and does not send BYE
        to Unity\\n\\nWorkaround 2 :  Use Skinny Integration\\n\\nWorkaround  3: Upgrade
        to Release Containing the Fix of this Defect , This Fix will not be automatically
        Enabled upon upgrade as it is driven by the Configuration Parameter, Hence
        Follow the Below  mentioned Procedure to Enable the Fix. However if it is
        Once Enabled it will remain persistent for future upgrades.\\n\\nNote 1: Run
        below Queries only on Publisher , before running below queries make sure Unity
        Connection DB replication is all good using the command \\\"show cuc cluster
        status\\\"\\nNote 2: This fix should be enabled during the MW as it will require
        restart of Critical Service \\\"Connection Mixer\\\"\\n\\nProcedure:\\nStep
        1 : Run the Below Query to get the Configuration Setting , valuebool \\\"0\\\"
        means Fix is disabled. If no Rows returned that means Release does not have
        fix of the defect\\nadmin:run cuc dbquery unitydirdb select valuebool from
        tbl_configuration where fullname ='System.Mixer.EnableSendSIDPacketsDuringRecord'\\nvaluebool\\n---------\\n0\\n\\nStep
        2: Enable the Fix using Below Command by setting the valuebool to 1\\nadmin:run
        cuc dbquery unitydirdb execute procedure csp_configurationmodify(pfullname='System.Mixer.EnableSendSIDPacketsDuringRecord',pvaluebool=1)\\n\\nStep
        3: Confirm that Fix is Enabled , valuebool will be Set to 1 \\nadmin:run cuc
        dbquery unitydirdb select valuebool from tbl_configuration where fullname
        ='System.Mixer.EnableSendSIDPacketsDuringRecord'\\nvaluebool\\n---------\\n1\\nStep
        4 : This change will not come into effect until  \\\"Connection Mixer\\\"
        Service is restarted after enabling the value as stated above, If it is a
        Cluster then Need to restart \\\"Connection Mixer\\\" Service on both the
        Nodes(Publisher and Subscriber) in the Cluster \\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE : Since Unity
        does not support RTCP , hence till the time RTCP is implemented , this defect
        fix can workaround this issue for Customer(s).\\n\\n<B>Further Problem Description:</B>\\n\\n\",\"severity\":\"6\",\"status\":\"F\",\"behavior_changed\":\"true\",\"last_modified_date\":\"2021-11-15\",\"product\":\"connection\",\"known_affected_releases\":\"10.5(2)

        then make the next change, wait for the sync process to complete, then make
        the third change to complete the swap and wait another replication interval.

        fix not working after upgrading to 11.5ES release which contains the fix for
        CSCvf68427\n\n<B>Conditions:</B>\n1) Install any 11.5ES old build which doesn''t
        contain the fix and check \"isSingleTon\" flag for task \"Validate Connection
        Location Passwords\" from CLI . The value should be N (Non Singleton)\n\nshow
        cuc sysagent tasks list\n\n2) Upgrade this build to 11.5ES build which contains
        the fix \n3) Post Upgrade check the same value using CLI mentioned in Step
        1.\n\nExpected Results : Task should be SingleTon with value as Y.\n\nObserved
        Results : Task was non-Singleton with value as N.\n\n<B>Workaround:</B>\nPlease
        follow below workaround for this defect :\n\n1) 1st Workaround is to upgrade
        to setup which has fix for this defect raised to handle upgrade scenario  (Recommended)\n\n2)
        2nd Workaround is to perform changes manually to default DB script and reload
        it (Not recommended)\n\n1) Generate root for node which has being upgraded
        to release having fix for CSCvf68427\n2) Go to /opt/cisco/connection/lib/config-modules/dbscripts/defaultdata/\n3)
        Take backup of original python file \"sysagenttasks.py\" file at same location\n4)
        Open file using \"vi sysagenttasks.py\" and follow below steps\n\nGo to Method
        : def AddTaskPeriod (taskDefinitionName, period):\n\nSearch For below Line
        : \n\n               if taskDefinitionName==\"Data.NetworkRemover\":\n                        sql.execute(\"UPDATE
        tbl_Taskperiodic SET issingleton=0 WHERE taskdefinitionname=?\",[taskDefinitionName])\n                        log.debug(\"Updated
        Singleton to 0 for NetworkRemover task\")\n\n\nAfter above line , add below
        lines to fix the problem (making task Singleton)\n\n              if taskDefinitionName==\"Client.ValidateEnterprisePasswordsTask\":\n                        sql.execute(\"UPDATE
        tbl_Taskperiodic SET issingleton=1 WHERE taskdefinitionname=?\",[taskDefinitionName])\n                        log.debug(\"Updated
        Singleton to 1 for ValidateEnterprisePasswordsTask task\")\n\n\n5) MAke sure
        alignment is proper as python requires proper alignment to execute \n6)  Once
        done with changes save the file and Go to /opt/cisco/connection/lib/config-modules/dbscripts/\n7)
        Copy the file \"UnityDirDbDefaultData.py\" as UnityDirDbDefaultData_test.py\n8)
        Open the file UnityDirDbDefaultData_test.py created above and remove all modules
        from primary_modules in run function except \"sysagenttasks\"\n9) source /opt/cisco/connection/lib/connection.profile\n10)
        Run \"python UnityDirDbDefaultData_test.py\" and it will update the DB properly
        and task will be singleton \n11) Restart \"Connection Sysagent\" service and
        we are good to go with fix for CSCvf68427 successfully\n\nAbove steps needs
        to be performed by TAC but carefully as python is tricky to work with . In
        case TAC is unable to perform the steps contact BU for the same\n\n<B>Further
        Problem Description:</B>\nThis defect is just to cater the upgrade scenario
        missed as part of CSCvf68427 and does not contain any new changes\n\n","severity":"4","status":"F","behavior_changed":"N","last_modified_date":"2021-05-22","product":"Cisco

        Connection unauthorized access vulnerability","description":"<b>Symptom:</b>\nA
        vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration products based
        on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform could allow an unauthenticated,
        remote attacker to gain unauthorized, elevated access to an affected device.\n\nThe
        vulnerability occurs when a refresh upgrade or Prime Collaboration Deployment
        (PCD) migration is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade
        or PCD migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains enabled
        and could allow root access to the device with a known password.\n\nIf the
        vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the standard upgrade method
        to an Engineering Special Release, service update, or a new major release
        of the affected product, this vulnerability is remediated by that action.\n\nNote:
        Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to
        the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker
        who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state
        could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker
        to compromise the affected system completely.\n\nCisco has released software
        updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address
        this vulnerability. \n\nThis advisory is available at the following link:

        to update user through REST API (e.g. when provisioning through CUCDM/VOSS4UC),
        getting \\\"Invalid country code \\\" error response from CUC.\\n\\nNote:
        at the same time, able to add the user through API with the same country code

        CUC user through API, when country set for user is not in vw_LanguageMap table
        (e.g. GH for Ghana).\\n\\n<B>Workaround:</B>\\nChange country to working one
        -> update the user -> change back to original one.\\n\\n<B>Further Problem
        Description:</B>\\nThere are three ways by which we can modify or add the
        country.\\n- Through Web GUI (No issue)\\n- Creating new User through REST
        API (No issue)\\n- Updating User through REST API (Facing issue)\\n\\n1.      Through
        Web GUI\\nWhen user selects the country from drop down menu say Ghana, while
        saving the page it passes the country code itself i.e. GH instead of Ghana.\\nIf
        we follow the flow behind this, it actually uses the value-name pair of <option>
        tag to determine the Country code.\\nWe populate this list through custom
        tag library. So after selecting any country it directly passes the country
        code to the DB, there is no validation or conversion of country code here.
        So there will be no issue while updating country through Web GUI.\\n\\n2.
        \     Creating new User through REST API\\nWhile creating a new user through
        REST API using POST request we only validate the mandatory fields and we do
        not validate country field. \\nSo If you try to create new User with any country
        code it will pass successfully. And you will be able to see that through GUI
        as again here it will fetch the country code from DB and on GUI it will map
        country code using value-name pair of <option> tag and shows you the correct
        country.\\n\\n3.      Updating User through REST API\\nWhile updating any
        field through REST API using PUT request we validate that field first. In
        this scenario also we are validating the country code where it fails by returning
        invalid country code.\\nHere while validating country code it calls checkCountryCode()
        function which performs a DB query to validate the country code select *  from
        vw_LanguageMap where languagetag LIKE '%GH' .\\nFrom query it's clear that
        it is going for table vw_languagemap for checking the entry. And that table
        is populated from an XML file  /opt/cisco/connection/lib/config-modules/dbscripts/defaultdata/languagemap.xml,
        This xml contains the ISO standard language code list. Which does not have
        entry for all countries. So while validating through this table it gets failed
        as the list does not have all countries.\\n\\n\",\"severity\":\"6\",\"status\":\"F\",\"behavior_changed\":\"N\",\"last_modified_date\":\"2020-12-18\",\"product\":\"Cisco

        have more than 50 partitions will list the other sites partition under alternate
        extension field. This allows the customer to add the alternate extension to
        the partition which is not local to the site.\n\nWe can see that when the
        user goes to add the partition to the alternate extension it runs below query  :\n\nSELECT
        ObjectId, Name, Description, LocationObjectId FROM vw_Partition WHERE LocationObjectId
        = ? AND LocationObjectId = ? ORDER BY fn_tolower(name) ASC, fn_tolower(name)
        ASC\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM vw_Partition WHERE LocationObjectId = ? AND LocationObjectId
        = ?\n\nIt specifies that the alternate extension should be assigned a partition
        that belongs to local locationobjectid or local server. On the condition that
        the partitions exceed count of 50 it gives an option pop up to search and
        assign partition objectid :\n  <td>\n        <cusac:combobox property=\"partitionObjectId\"

        to update user through REST API (e.g. when provisioning through CUCDM/VOSS4UC),
        getting \"Invalid country code \" error response from CUC.\n\nNote: at the
        same time, able to add the user through API with the same country code and
        also able to set this country / update the user through WebUI.\n\n<B>Conditions:</B>\nUpdating
        CUC user through API, when country set for user is not in vw_LanguageMap table
        (e.g. GH for Ghana).\n\n<B>Workaround:</B>\nChange country to working one
        - update the user - change back to original one.\n\n<B>Further Problem Description:</B>\nThere
        are three ways by which we can modify or add the country.\n- Through Web GUI
        (No issue)\n- Updating User through REST API (Facing issue)\n\n1.      Through
        Web GUI\nWhen user selects the country from drop down menu say Ghana, while
        saving the page it passes the country code itself i.e. GH instead of Ghana.\nIf
        we follow the flow behind this, it actually uses the value-name pair of <option>
        tag to determine the Country code.\nWe populate this list through custom tag
        library. So after selecting any country it directly passes the country code
        to the DB, there is no validation or conversion of country code here. So there
        will be no issue while updating country through Web GUI.\n\n2.      Creating
        new User through REST API\nWhile creating a new user through REST API using
        POST request we only validate the mandatory fields and we do not validate
        country field. So If you try to create new User with any country code it will
        pass successfully. And you will be able to see that through GUI as again here
        it will fetch the country code from DB and on GUI it will map country code
        using value-name pair of <option> tag and shows you the correct country.\n\n3.      Updating
        User through REST API\nWhile updating any field through REST API using PUT
        request we validate that field first. In this scenario also we are validating
        the country code where it fails by returning invalid country code.\nHere while
        validating country code it calls checkCountryCode() function which performs
        a DB query to validate the country code select *  from vw_LanguageMap where
        languagetag LIKE ''%GH'' .\nFrom query it''s clear that it is going for table
        vw_languagemap for checking the entry. And that table is populated from an
        XML file  /opt/cisco/connection/lib/config-modules/dbscripts/defaultdata/languagemap.xml,
        This xml contains the ISO standard language code list. Which does not have
        entry for all countries. So while validating through this table it gets failed
        as the list does not have all countries.\n\n","severity":"6","status":"O","behavior_changed":"","last_modified_date":"2018-09-14","product":"Cisco

        Description:</B>\nWhen we log in and try to change the password from TUI we
        get the below extra state : PlayPWintro that tells user how long the  pin
        needs to be  . This state is however not called when the password expires
        assuming that the user would know the default length of the password from
        introduction played to him at the time of setting is pin from TUI for the
        first time. Moreover we keep prompting the user a few days prior to the password
        expiry to let him change the password from TUI . If he follows that option
        the intro will be played. However there is a difference as it is quite evidently
        played to the customer that the PIN has expired and the invalid pin option
        comes when he is trying to change it and not when he tries to log in. So while
        changing pin if it says invalid pin that means that pin has to be set with
        standards set in authentication rule. Below is the difference .\n_____________________\nLog
